> NOTE: This is still a work in progress. Some RAG and agent related features of Llamastack is demonstrated. We are still researching and implementing advanced tool calling and MCP server integration.

These notebooks are part of the competitor analysis use-case/prooof-of-concept.

Before running these notebooks on Red Hat OpenShift AI, you need to prepare the RHOAI environment. See https://github.com/rsriniva/competitor-analysis for instructions on how to prepare the environment.
